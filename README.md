# dotfiles
My dotfiles.

- **init.vim** is my custom Neovim config.
- **chadrc.lua** is my custom settings for [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad), a pretty cool base config for Neovim. I'm migrating away from using my own config, and towards this.
- **profile** contains the shell commands I tend to use day-to-day.
